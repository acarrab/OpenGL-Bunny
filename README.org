# OpenGL-Bunny
# This is written in a markup language called org mode.
* Recent Notes
We added in motion blur and texture mapping on top of the other features.

There is a makefile so to run just do this stuff.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[0] make run
#+END_SRC

If you want to run multiple times, you can do a plain make and then run separately
#+BEGIN_SRC python
acarrab@Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[1] make
acarrab@Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[2] ./run
#+END_SRC

You can also make clean
#+BEGIN_SRC python
Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[3] make clean
#+END_SRC
