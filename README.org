* Recent Notes
Hey guys, I wrote some code for parsing and reading in the data and making the
bunny show. It is no longer split into a bunch of files, but now uses VBO for
holding the bunny's data.

It also now rotates, similarly to his rotating cube example. We can now see what
we are doing a bit easier. There are also some comments to show what I changed
in the code. The comments are marked with ### to distinguish my comments from
Dr. Geists.


The makefile is pretty much the same still

#+BEGIN_SRC python
Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[0] make
Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[1] ./run


Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[2] make clean
rm -rf driver.o parser.o
rm -rf run
