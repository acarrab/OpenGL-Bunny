* Recent Notes
Hey guys, I wrote some code for parsing and reading in the data and making the
bunny show. It is no longer split into a bunch of files, but now uses VBO for
holding the bunny's data.

It also now rotates, similarly to his rotating cube example. We can now see what
we are doing a bit easier. There are also some comments to show what I changed
in the code. The comments are marked with ### to distinguish my comments from
Dr. Geists.


The makefile is pretty much the same still

#+BEGIN_SRC python
Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[0] make
Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[1] ./run
#+END_SRC

The min and max x,y,z values are just showing the position of the bunny in 3d space.
Also, please run make clean before committing changes

#+BEGIN_SRC python
Compy:~/Desktop/OpenGL-Bunny[2] make clean
rm -rf driver.o parser.o
rm -rf run
#+END_SRC

** Our Todo list
- Change lighting and colors to be used
  - This is to be done in lighting.c
- Change material, things like shininess.
  - To be done in material.c
- Fix the view volumes up direction
  - To be done in viewVolume.c
- Maybe apply transform to bunny to rotate to a better viewing angle
  - To be done in drawStuff.c
- We must implement one of the following features as well.
  - Motion-blur
  - Depth of Field
  - Textures
  - Shadows
  - A user interface with selectable eye point and view direction.

** Our done list
- Parsing
- Basic drawStuff layout
